I'll build you a modern, mobile-first portfolio using a "Link-in-Bio" style layout.
This design is extremely popular right now because it looks 
fantastic on phones while still scaling up nicely for desktops.

I'm using HTML with Tailwind CSS (loaded directly via a script) so you don't need to install anything.
You can just upload this single file to GitHub, enable GitHub Pages, 
and it will work immediately.
